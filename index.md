## About Me

Hi! My name is Sohaib Ahmad. I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst working under the supervision of [Prof. Ramesh Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/) and [Prof. Hui Guan](https://guanh01.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of systems and machine learning: I use machine learning to improve the performance of computer systems, and use my systems knowledge to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. I build theoretical models to represent distributed data processing systems, and use the models to improve the performance and efficiency of those systems.

I also collaborate with [Prof. Abhishek Chandra](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~chandra/).

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_dPMSew2gCv2PwIa7aJ1I368gsuPkVV/view?usp=sharing).

I recently wrapped up an internship at Meta (formerly Facebook) with their Serverless Computing team. Previously, I have also been involved as a student researcher at Bell Labs research under the supervision of [Thomas Woo](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/researcher-profiles/thomaswoo/#gref).

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my undergrad from LUMS in 2017 under the supervision of [Prof. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~ihsan/) where my research focused on computer networks and measurement.
